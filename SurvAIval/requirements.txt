# Notes:
# - Ensure FFmpeg is installed system-wide (see README.md).
# - Some TTS models might require 'espeak-ng' installed system-wide (see README.md).
# - For specific hardware acceleration (like CUDA), you might need different torch versions.
#   Install the correct PyTorch version for your system from: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#   Example for CPU-only: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# - Pinning versions (e.g., numpy==1.26.4) is recommended for reproducible environments.
